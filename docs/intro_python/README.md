# Python 

Python is an open source programming language

## Why Python ?
Python, for the layman, is a general purpose programming language. First developed way back in 1991, it was created around the notion that code should be as readable as possible so that it’s easily understood. Python has a simple syntax that makes it suitable for learning programming as a first language. The learning curve is smoother than other languages.

+ Python is quick and efficient, 
+ it doesn’t require much complicated signs and symbols such as **`$$ //`** :
+ It’s user friendly - it’s easy to learn
+ It has an interactive shell you can enter programs run and start off
+ It has the turtle module that is useful and fun for kids etc…

Example of Hello World in few programming languages compared to Python

**C**

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(){
    printf("\nHello world!");
    return 0;
}
```

**C++**

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main () {
    std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
}
```

**C#**

```c
Using System

Class MainClass {
    Public static void Main (string[] args) { 
        Console.WriteLine ("Hello World");
    }
}
```

**Java**

```java
Class Main {
	Public static void(String[] args) {
    	System.out.println("Hello world!");
    }
}
```

**PHP**

```php
<?php
echo "Hello, world!";
?>
```

**Python**

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```



## What is Python used for ?
+ Web Development, using the frameworks Django, Flask, Pylons
+ Data Science and Visualization using Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib
+ Machine learning with Tensorflow and Scikit-learn
+ Desktop applications with PyQt, Gtk, wxWidgets and many more
+ Mobile applications using Kivy or BeeWare
+ Education: Python is a great language to learn programming!

> Instructor should highlight the role of the various careers if need be not forgetting programming evangelist/educationist as a career.
