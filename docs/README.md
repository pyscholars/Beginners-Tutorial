## Introduction
Welcome to the PyScholars Tutorial!
The aim of the PyScholars initiative is focused on students in the senior high level where students would be introduced to Python programming in a relaxed and fun environment. 

It is a voluntary enrollment program for students, however, depending on each school’s vision, the school’s management may decide to make it mandatory if the initiative aligns with their long term objectives. A class would generally be capped at 20 students to have more impact as we are trying for starts, to focus on the quality we get and not the quantity.

We are happy to see you here :) In this tutorial, we will take you on a journey to learn the basic understanding of what programming is, and give you the ability to do some simple (application level) programming where you could build then build your own games, websites/blogs and use the Raspberry Pi as a team or individually.

As with all unknown things, this is going to be an adventure - but no worries, since you already worked up the courage to be here, you'll be just fine :)


## What will you learn during the tutorial?
PyScholars syllabus is broken down into three main phases in a year. Each phase would be designed to match each academic term (normally consists of 3months)

**Phase One** - The technical material to be covered during this phase would involve:
+ Introduction to Programming
+ Introduction to Python 

**Phase Two** - Here, we would delve into a little deeper. We will build on what kids learned in "Intro to Programming" and build on it to strengthen skills. Through practical examples, students will gain a deeper understanding of programming and how it is applied in the real world. Example projects will reinforce understanding of fundamentals while encouraging experimentation and exploration. 
+ Introduction to Git
+ Building various applications such as games, calculators etc

**Phase Three** - This would focus more on students' interests. The class would be divided into
two parts.
+ Hardware focused: This would involve the building of basic robotics, and hardware components
such as Raspberry Pi.
+ Software focused: This would involve working on a web-base app using Django and hosting it on PythonAnywhere.
