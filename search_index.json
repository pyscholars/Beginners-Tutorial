A class would generally be capped at 20 students to have more impact as we are trying for starts, to focus on the quality we get and not the quantity.\nWe are happy to see you here :) In this tutorial, we will take you on a journey to learn the basic understanding of what programming is, and give you the ability to do some simple (application level) programming where you could build then build your own games, websites/blogs and use the Raspberry Pi as a team or individually.\nAs with all unknown things, this is going to be an adventure - but no worries, since you already worked up the courage to be here, you'll be just fine :)\nWhat will you learn during the tutorial?\nPyScholars syllabus is broken down into three main phases in a year. Each phase would be designed to match each academic term (normally consists of 3months)\nPhase One - The technical material to be covered during this phase would involve:\n\nIntroduction to Programming\nIntroduction to Python \n\nPhase Two - Here, we would delve into a little deeper. We will build on what kids learned in \"Intro to Programming\" and build on it to strengthen skills. Through practical examples, students will gain a deeper understanding of programming and how it is applied in the real world. Example projects will reinforce understanding of fundamentals while encouraging experimentation and exploration. \n\nIntroduction to Git\nBuilding various applications such as games, calculators etc\n\nPhase Three - This would focus more on students' interests. The class would be divided into\ntwo parts.\n\nHardware focused: This would involve the building of basic robotics, and hardware components\nsuch as Raspberry Pi.\nSoftware focused: This would involve working on a web-base app using Django and hosting it on PythonAnywhere.\n\nYou can visit our website on https://www.pyscholars.org\n"},"intro_programming/":{"url":"intro_programming/","title":"What is Programming?","keywords":"","body":"Introduction to programming\nAccording to research, students learn best when they take an active part in what is to be learned. They love the cool fun way to learn things so asking\nthem questions and making the class interactive would really help you in the\nintroduction to Programming.\nSo what is programming? \nWhat is programming?\nThe process of developing and implementing various sets of instructions to enable a\ncomputer to do a certain task. These instructions are considered computer programs and help the computer to operate smoothly. The language used to program computers is not understood by an untrained eye.\nRead more: http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/computer-programming.html\n\nInstructor should engage about the opinion if they heard anything about programming and explain further with examples if necessary. ( You can use a site like YouTube/Facebook which all students would be familiar with. A mockup can be used to illustrate how these sites work)\n\nProgramming Languages\nA programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks. The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages, such as BASIC, C, C++, Python, COBOL, Java, FORTRAN, Ada, and Pascal.\nRead more: https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/programming_language.html\n\nInstructor at this point should compare and contrast programming languages to everyday human languages like english.\n\nProgramming Careers\n\nSoftware application developer\nWeb developer\nMobile developer\nComputer systems engineer\nDatabase administrator\nComputer systems analyst\nData Scientist\nSoftware quality assurance (QA) engineer\nBusiness intelligence analyst\nComputer programmer and more \n\nRead more: https://www.rasmussen.edu/degrees/technology/blog/programming-careers-for-coding-connoisseurs/\n\nInstructor should highlight the role of the various careers if need be not forgetting programming evangelist/educationist as a career.You can go forward to explain the following as some students might have confusion between programming and coding.\n\nCoding is the process of using a programming language to get a computer to behave how you want it to. Every line of code tells the computer to do something, and a document full of lines of code is called a script.\n"},"intro_python/":{"url":"intro_python/","title":"Introduction to Python","keywords":"","body":"Python\nPython is an open source programming language\nWhy Python ?\nPython, for the layman, is a general purpose programming language.

Another way of looking at a variable is that it’s like a label for something.\nFor example, to create a variable named mark, we use an equal sign = and then tell Python what information the variable should be the label for. Here, we create the variable mark and tell Python that it label’s the number 100 (note that this doesn’t mean that another variable can’t have the same value):\nIn [2]: mark = 100\nNow that we have assigned 100 to mark we would love to find out the value of mark and to find  what value a variable labels, enter print in the shell, followed by the variable name in parentheses, like this:\nIn [2]: print(mark)Out[2]: 100\n\nInstructor can use more examples to allow the scholars understand more\n\nVariables Names\nVariables can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). \nBut there are few rules for Python variables:\n\nA variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character\nA variable name can never begin with a number\nA variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )\nVariable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)\nPython reserved words cannot be used as variables (int, for, if, else, etc)\n\n"},"python/datatypes.html":{"url":"python/datatypes.html","title":"Data Types","keywords":"","body":"Data types\nNumbers\nPython supports two types of numbers - Integers and floating point numbers\nIn [2]: myint = 6        myfloat = 6.0        print(myint)        print(myfloat)\nOut[2]: 6         6.0\n\nAs seen above integers are whole numbers as known by students, there is effectively no limit to how long an integer value can be. While float numbers are decimal numbers as known in maths to student\n\n\n\nType\nFormat\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nint\na=10\nSigned Integer\n\n\nlong\na=345L\n(L) Long integers, they can also be represented in octal and hexadecimal\n\n\nfloat\na=45.67\n(.) Floating point real values\n\n\ncomplex\na=3.14J\n(J) Contains integer in the range 0 to 255.\n\n\n\nStrings\nA string in Python is a sequence of characters. It is a derived data type. A character is simply a symbol. For example, the English language has 26 characters.\nIn [2]: str = \"This is a string\"        print (str)      # Prints complete string        print (str[0])   # Prints first character of the string        print (str[2:5]) # Prints characters starting from 3rd to 5th        print (str[2:1)  # Prints string starting from 3rd character        print (str 2)    # Prints string two times        print (str + \"ADD THIS\") # Prints concatenated string\nOut[2]: This is a string\n        T\n        is\n        is is a string\n        This is a string This is a string\n        This is a stringADD THIS\n\nPython uses single quotes ' double quotes \" and triple quotes \"\"\" to denote literal strings. Only the triple quoted strings \"\"\" also will automatically continue across the end of line statement.\nIn [2]: firstName = 'mannie'        last Name = \"young\"        message = \"\"\"This shows a string that will span across multiple         lines Using newline characters and no spaces for the next lines.         The end of lines within this string also count as a newline when         printed\"\"\"        print (firstName)        print (lastName)        print (message)Out[2]: mannie        young         This shows a string that will span across multiple lines\n        Using newline characters and no spaces for the next lines.         The end of lines within this string also count as a newline when         printed\n\nPython can use a special syntax to format multiple strings and numbers. We would cover the string formatter here briefly because it is seen often and it is important to recognize the syntax.\nIn [2]: print (\"My name is (). I love to {}\".format(\"Mannie\", \"code\"))Out[2]: My name is Mannie, I love to code\n\nThe {} are placeholders that are substituted by Mannie and code in the final string. This compact syntax is meant to keep the code more readable and compact. Python is currently transitioning to the format syntax above.\nDeleting a string entirely is possible using the keyword del. So if we want to delete lastname we simply do del lastname\nList\nLists are a very useful variable type in Python. A list can contain a series of values. List variables are declared by using brackets [ ] following the variable name. Yes Lists are exactly what you think they are: objects which are lists of other objects.\nIn [2]: home = []    # This is a blank list variable        names = [\"Smith\", \"Ruth\", \"Rio\") # list creates a list names.        marks = [90, 88, 87] # lists can have different data types.\n\nSo as seen above, we have created lists for home which is an empty list, names and marks! What can we do with it? \nIn [2]: print (len(names))        print (names[1])        print (marks[0:2])Out[2]: 3        Ruth        [90, 88]\n\nAbove we used the len() function to can give us a number of objects in the list names. We also returned the value at index 1 of names, which is 'Ruth'. Note that The list index starts at zero.\nYou can add items to a list, we use the append function. A function is a chunk of code that tells Python to do something. In this case, append adds an item to the end of a list.\nIn [2]: home = []    # This is a blank list variable        names = [\"Smith\", \"Ruth\", \"Rio\"] # list creates a list names.        marks = [90, 88, 87] # lists can have different data types.\nWe would try to add a new name Anthony to our list names.\nIn [2]: names.append('Anthony')\nNow lets print out our list to see the changes.\nIn [2]: print(names)Out[2]: ['Smith', 'Ruth', 'Rio', 'Anthony']\nNow we can see that we now have Anthony included in the list names. \nWe can also remove a name from the list, and to do this we would use the del command (short for delete). \nFor example, to remove the third item in the names list, Rio, we would do this:\nIn [2]: del names [2]\nNow lets print out our list to see the changes.\nIn [2]: print(names)Out[2]: ['Smith', 'Ruth', 'Anthony']\nNow we can see that Rio has been deleted from the list names. \n\nInstructor should remind the scholars the positions start at zero, so names[2] actually refers to the third item in the list.\n\nTuples\nTuples are a group of values like a list and are manipulated in similar ways. But, tuples are fixed in size once they are assigned. A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas. The main differences between lists and tuples are: Lists are enclosed in brackets [ ] and their elements and size can be changed, while tuples are enclosed in parentheses ( ) and cannot be updated. \nIn [2]: home_tuple = ()    # This is a blank tuple variable        names = (\"Anthony\",\"Abigail\",\"Michael\") #creates tuple of names        marks = (90, 88, 87) # tuples contain that integers.\nSo as seen above, we have created tuples for home which is an empty list, names and marks!\nIn [2]: print (len(home_tuple))        print (len(names))        print (names)        print ('3rd mark: ', marks[2])Out[2]: 0        3        ('Anthony', 'Abigail', 'Michael')        3rd mark: 93\nAbove we used the len() function to can give us a number of objects in the tuple home_tuple, notice the output is 0 since the tuple is empty. We also returned the value at index 2 of marks, which is 93. Note that The list index starts at zero.\nDictionary\nIn Python a dictionary is a collection of things, like lists and tuples. The difference between dictionaries and lists or tuples is that each item in a dictionary has a key and a corresponding value. \nCreating a dictionary is as simple as placing items inside curly braces {} separated by comma. An item has a key and the corresponding value expressed as a pair, key: value. While values can be of any data type and can repeat, keys must be of immutable type (string, number or tuple with immutable elements) and must be unique.\nNow lets create a dictionary called student:\nIn [2]: student = {'Name': 'Ernie', 'Age': 16, 'Class': 'First'}\nAs seen above have created a dictionary student with the keys Name, Age and Class and also they have the values  Ernie, 16 and First respectively.\nIn [2]: print(student['Name']) # displays name of the student        print (student['class']) # displays class of the studentOut[2]: Ernie        First\nAs seen above we have printed out the Name and Class from the dictionary. Now lets see how we can update the age from 16 to 18 and also add a new key called Address to the dictionary.\nIn [2]: student['Age'] = 18 # This updates the value for Age        student['Address'] = 'WestHills' # adds a new Key with the value\nWe have updated the Age and added the Address to our dictionary, now lets see the output.\nIn [2]: print(student)        print(student['Age'])        print(student['Address'])Out[2]: {'Name':'Ernie','Age':18,'Class':'First','Address':'WestHills'}        18        WestHills\nAs seen above our dictionary now have the updated Age and also the new key Address\n\nInstructor can also inform the scholars that dictionaries can also be deleted using the Key pop() 'Age' method to delete an item in the dictionary. \n\n"},"python/functions.html":{"url":"python/functions.html","title":"Functions","keywords":"","body":"Functions\nA function is defined as a block of organized, reusable code used to perform a single, related action. Python has many built-in functions; you can also create your own.\nLet's take a look at the print and len function in Python. \nThe  print(object) function prints the given object to the standard output device (screen) or to the text stream file. That’s why if you type in print(\"Hello World\") you get the output Hello World. \nSame goes for len, The len(object) function returns the number of items in an object.When the object is a string, the len() function returns the number of characters in the string.\nNow let's create our own function to use for greeting.\nIn [2]: def greet (name):        \"\"\"This function greets         the name passed in as         parameter\"\"\"         print(\"Good morning! Mr \"+ name +\". How are you doing today? \")\nSo above we have defined our function greet, lets see what happens when we execute our function.\nIn [2]: greet('Michael')Out[2]: Good morning! Mr Michael. How are you doing today?\nSo we can see that when we made the object name \"Michael\" we have an output that greets Michael from the function. Now the advantage of this is let’s assume you have an app that need to greet a user.

Without it, things can get real confusing, real fast.\nIn Python we have two methods when commenting, these are the:\nConsecutive Single-line Comments: Here you simply use a # single-line comment on every line\nMulti-line Strings as Comments: Here you use the \"\"\" syntax to create a multi line comment.\nIn [2]: # Here inputs are requested and stored in variables test and num        text = input (\"Type anything: \")        num = input (\"Enter a number: \")        # Prints in the console the variable as requested        print (\"\\n You typed in: \", text)        print (\"\\nThe number you entered is: \", num)        \"\"\"        This converts the string into a integer using int() for decimal        format we use the float() function         \"\"\"        num type = int(num)        # This would inform you on the type of input you entered        print(\"\\n The Data type for text is : \",type(text))        print(\"\\nThe Data type for num is: \", type(num type))Out[2]: Type anything:         Enter a number:         You typed in: Hello there!

Let’s take a look at the output when we enter a negative number. \nOut[2]: Enter a number:         -5 is a negative number.\nAs seen above that the output we get is from the else condition since the number -5 is a negative number.\nLet's take a look at another scenario, I believe we all make use of apps that ask for our username and passwords when logging in.\nIn [2]: username = input(\"\\nPlease enter username? \")        password = input(\"\\nPlease enter password \")        if username == 'tina':            print('\\nHello Tina')        else:            print('\\incorrect username')        if password == 'swordfish'            print('Access granted! Welcome Tina.')        else:            print('incorrect password')\nAbove we have created a variable for username and password to receive the input tina as the username and swordfish as the password. From what we have if the username provided is tina the output would be Hello Tina and if it’s not (else) it gives the output incorrect username. Same goes for the password. Let's take a look at the output for both an incorrect input and a correct one.\nOut[2]: Please enter username?:         Please enter password:          Hello Tina        incorrect password\nAs seen above we provided the correct username tina but gave a wrong password catwoman and that can be seen from the output we got. \nelif Statement\nelif condition tells the program to print out the third condition or possibility when the other condition goes wrong or incorrect. The elif is short for else if. It allows the program to check for multiple expressions. For example if the condition for our if is False, it checks the condition of the next elif block and so on. If all the conditions are False, body of else is then executed.\nif expression:\n    statement(s)\nelif another expression:\n    statement(s)\nelif another expression:\n    statement(s)\nelse:\n    statement(s)\n\nLet's take a look at an example\nIn [2]: num = input(\"\\nEnter a number: \")        number = int(num)        if number > 0:            print(number, \"is a positive number.\")        elif number == 0:            print(number, \"is neither a positive nor negative number.\")        else:            print(number, \"is a negative number.\")\nFrom what we can see above, we now have an elif condition to check and give an output if the user gives the number 0 which is neither positive nor negative. Let's take a look at the output.\nOut[2]: Enter a number:         0 is neither a positive nor negative number.\nAfter running our program we receive an output from the elif condition because the user provided 0 as the number.\nNested if Statement\nDo you know we can have a if...elif...else statement inside another if...elif...else statement?.\nYes!  This is called nesting in computer programming. Any number of these statements can be nested inside one another. But this can get confusing, so you must be avoided if we can. Let's look at an example.\nIn [2]:  num = float(input(\"Enter a number: \")        if num >= 0:            if num == 0:                print(number,\"is neither positive nor negative number.\")             else:                print(num, \"is a positive number.\")        else:            print (num, \"is a negative number.\")\nAbove is an example of a nested if statement. You can try and run it, yes it looks similar to our elif example but this is a different approach. You can notice that here we converted the user’s input to a float() using a different style from the int() we used previously.\n"},"python/loops.html":{"url":"python/loops.html","title":"Loops","keywords":"","body":"Loops\nA loop in a computer program is an instruction that repeats until a specified condition is reached. In a loop structure, the loop asks a question. If the answer requires action, it is executed. The same question is asked again and again until no further action is required. Each time the question is asked is called an iteration.\nfor loop\nA for loop is a loop that runs for a preset number of times. It is often used when you have a piece of code which you want to repeat \"n\" number of times. \nfor value in sequence:\n    statement(s)\n\nAbove we see the for loop syntax, Here, val is the variable that takes the value of the item inside the sequence on each iteration. Let’s now take a look at an example.\nIn [2]: months = [\"Jan\", \"Feb\", \"Mar\",\"April\", \"May\",\"June\"]        for month in months:            print(month)\nAbove, we have a list of the first 6 months of the year. We also have a for loop that reads, for every element that we assign the variable month, in the list months, print out the variable month.\nOut[2]: Jan        Feb        Mar        April        May        June\nAnd above we have the output of our loop.\nwhile loop\nThe while loop is used to repeat a specific block of code an unknown number of times, until a condition is met. Let’s now take a look at an example.\nIn [2]: numbers = 0        while numbers  10:            print(numbers)            numbers += 1\nAbove we have a loop that starts from 0 and increases by 1 until it is equal to 10. This means that while numbers is less than or equal to 10, print out numbers. Let’s take a look at the output\nOut[2]: 0        1        2        3        4        5        6        7        8        9        10\nAbove we can see that the outputs we got are the numbers from 0 to 10. \nThe same results we got from our while loop can be gotten in Python using the range() function. The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number. Let's take a look at an example of that.\nIn [2]: for numbers in range(0,10):            print(numbers)Out[2]: 0        1        2        3        4        5        6        7        8        9\nSo above we can see that the outputs we got are the numbers from 0 to 9. Some would be wondering why in the while loop we got 0 - 10 and here 0 - 9, this is be in our while loop we used the condition less than or equal to 10, this makes 10 included in the output displayed.\nBreak and Continue statements\nWith the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items,\nIn [2]: numbers = 0        while numbers  10:            if numbers = 5:                break            print (numbers)            numbers += 1Out[2]: 0        1        2        3        4\nAbove we included a break statement that if our loop get to 5 it should exit, and that can be seen in the output.\nWith continue statement we can stop the current iteration of the loop, and continue with the next\nIn [2]: months = [\"Jan\", \"Feb\", \"Mar\", \"April\", \"May\", \"June\"]        for month in months:            if month == \"April\":                continue            print(month)        print(\"\\nThe end\")Out[2]: Jan        Feb        Mar        May        June        The end\nAbove we have used the continue statement to skip “April”, and return to the for loop statement. In the output we can see that April isn’t part of the results.\n"},"python/project.html":{"url":"python/project.html","title":"Project","keywords":"","body":"Project on a Biography Bot\nWe would build a project with to make a Biography bot that asks for your input and gives back a summarized story using the inputs you give.\nWe would create a bot like app that you can name after yourself or a name you love.\nWe would also make use of the datetime module in python.
